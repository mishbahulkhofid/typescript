/**
 * An LMS stores student performance data below.
 * The school wants to analyze students using different criteria.
 * A student is considered academically successful if:
 * - Score ≥ 75
 * - Attendance ≥ 90%
 * 
 * 
 * The teacher wants to generate:
 *  - Pass/fail status.
 *  - Academic performance category.
 *  - Attendance status.
 *  - Final recommendation.
 * 
 * Recommendation Rules:
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | Condition                      | Recommendation               |
 * | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
 * | Score ≥ 90 AND attendance ≥ 90 | Excellent                    |
 * | Score ≥ 75 AND attendance ≥ 90 | Good                         |
 * | Score ≥ 75 BUT attendance < 90 | Improve Attendance           |
 * | Score < 75                     | Improve Academic Performance |
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------|
 * 
 * Challenge:
 * - processStudents() should know nothing about these rules.
 * - It should only process the students and execute the callback.
